# Acceptance Criteria Checklist

Checklist for verifying that all request instructions have been satisfied.

## Instruction Extraction

- [ ] Read the original request carefully
- [ ] List all explicit instructions (direct asks)
- [ ] Identify implicit instructions (clearly expected behaviors)
- [ ] Note any constraints or requirements mentioned
- [ ] Flag ambiguous terms that need clarification

## Instruction Mapping

For each instruction:
- [ ] Locate where it's implemented in the code
- [ ] Note the file and location (`file:line`)
- [ ] Determine status: Done / Partial / Missing

## Completeness Verification

For each instruction verify:
- [ ] The functionality is present
- [ ] It behaves as the request specified
- [ ] All aspects of the instruction are covered
- [ ] It matches the intent behind the request

## Gap Analysis

- [ ] List all missing instructions
- [ ] List all partially implemented instructions
- [ ] Note where implementation differs from request
- [ ] Document any assumptions made

## Final Verification

- [ ] Every explicit instruction has been addressed
- [ ] No instruction was overlooked or forgotten
- [ ] Implementation matches what was requested
- [ ] Gaps and assumptions are documented
- [ ] Verdict determined: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
