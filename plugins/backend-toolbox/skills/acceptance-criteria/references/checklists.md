# Acceptance Criteria Checklist

A checklist is provided for verifying that all request instructions have been satisfied.

## Instruction Extraction

- [ ] The original request should be read carefully
- [ ] All explicit instructions (direct asks) should be listed
- [ ] Implicit instructions (clearly expected behaviors) should be identified
- [ ] Any mentioned constraints or requirements should be noted
- [ ] Ambiguous terms that need clarification should be flagged

## Instruction Mapping

For each instruction, the following should be performed:
- [ ] Where it is implemented in the code should be identified
- [ ] The file and location (`file:line`) should be noted
- [ ] Status should be determined: Done / Partial / Missing

## Completeness Verification

For each instruction, the following should be verified:
- [ ] The functionality is present
- [ ] Behavior matches what was specified in the request
- [ ] All aspects of the instruction are covered
- [ ] The intent behind the request is matched

## Gap Analysis

- [ ] All missing instructions should be listed
- [ ] All partially implemented instructions should be listed
- [ ] Where implementation differs from the request should be noted
- [ ] Any assumptions made should be documented

## Final Verification

- [ ] Every explicit instruction has been addressed
- [ ] No instruction has been overlooked or forgotten
- [ ] Implementation matches what was requested
- [ ] Gaps and assumptions are documented
- [ ] A verdict is determined: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
